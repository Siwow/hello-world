# hello-world
My first repository
Hi everyone(me,myself,i),

I am a graduated electrical and electronics engineer who is not fond of his occupation, so i've been writing codes like 5 months periodically.I am working hard to learn Python (not that hard actually) so i will be able to work on my interests such as artificial intelligence and deep learning.

Don't let your head down, work work work but most importantly repetition is your key.

Good Luck!
